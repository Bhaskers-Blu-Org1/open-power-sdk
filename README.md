Welcome to the unofficial OpenPOWER SDK!

This repository currently serves primarily as a pointer to a different, active repository for tools and technologies related to IBM POWER and OpenPOWER processors and systems.  See https://github.com/open-power-sdk.

As this repository is under the "IBM" umbrella, it provides some additional authenticity for https://github.com/open-power-sdk.

But, OpenPOWER is not just "IBM".  It never was.  OpenPOWER is about a thriving open ecosystem around industry-leading processing and systems technologies and software.  It therefore does not make sense to constrain a repository about "OpenPOWER" solely under an "IBM" umbrella.

Please visit https://github.com/open-power-sdk, and freely participate!
